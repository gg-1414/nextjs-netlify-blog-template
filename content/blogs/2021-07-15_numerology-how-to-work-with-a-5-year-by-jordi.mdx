    “If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your
    attitude.” - Maya Angelou


    #### **What is numerology?**


    Numerology is the belief in the importance of numbers and the symbolism found in their relationship with patterns of this world.  These patterns coincide with astrology and occultism, and focus on the serendipity of repetition and practical aspects of numbers found in our everyday life.  One way that we measure time with numbers is through the Gregorian calendar, this year is 2021.  Adding each number separately you end up with the sum total of 5, the number we will focus on!


    2021=20+21=4+1=5


    #### **Elements of a 5 Year**


    5 is a number that teaches us the lessons of Freedom and Discipline.  It invites us during this cycle  to focus on the information we have learned so far, and apply it to create more stability (internally and externally).  We are asked to return to a childlike sense of self that invokes wonder, awe, and curiosity. 5 is like the Joker that asks, “Why so serious?” as they find joy in the disruption of the status quo, especially when these structures are rooted in colonial isms: ableism, classism, racism, etc.


    Time is paradoxical and change is the only constant.  As we enter into the second year of a new era initiated by the massive global shift of COVID-19, the disruption of the illusion of normalcy becomes more present.  Our environments are evolving drastically and we are challenged to adapt at alarming rates. Don’t fret!  These environments are where 5 thrives!  How can you practice consistency that changes as much as you do?  This year has brought many options for adapting to this new way of being.  Masks, vaccines, socially distanced large gatherings like concerts and sporting events became a part of our daily life. Returning to ‘normal’ is a dream many have still yet to wake from, although millions of people are present and readily embracing newness.  This state of readiness is the environment that 5 energy thrives in.


    #### **Working With a 5 Year**


    What is it you have learned this past year and how have these lessons impacted your life?  The energy of 5 truly is that of an alchemist, inviting you to use external changes to stimulate your inner world.  You have received vast amounts of information from your past experiences: what environments you desire, what people you want surrounding you, what your needs are, etc. and it’s time to use that knowledge.


    What do you do to increase your self awareness?  Journaling.  Meditation.  Stretching.  Touching your body.  This isn’t a call to build a daily routine but an invitation to build the arsenal of tools you have for deepening your relationship with yourself.


    * Work with your senses: Wear reds and yellows, eat warming foods like Ginger, Cayenne, and Jalapenos, Foods that are hydrating and stimulate flow like Watermelon, Cucumber, Lemons, and Hibiscus.

    * Affirmation: Name your alarm “I am expanding quickly with ease” use ‘I am’ affirmations on sticky notes around your mirror or closet.

    * Tend to the Environment: This looks different for people based on living situations and accessibility. What has aided me is investing in a [grounding mat](https://www.healthline.com/health/under-review-grounding-mats) to help supplement any lack of Earth contact. Support other beings to understand harmonious symbiotic relationships! Bird feeding, outdoor composting, and leaving peanuts for the squirrels, can illuminate the complexity of home life.

    * Traveling: By interacting with different people and environments, our brains open new pathways of being. For those not ready for physical travel, some methods of non-physical travel include: Meditation, travelling through art ie movies, books, music, research possible day trip options.


    This year continues to bring about vast amounts of change, the potential for creation is potent!  I hope that this information supports your journey as you learn new lessons and integrate them into your life for the purpose of growth and expansion.


    I love you with this affirmation to say out loud or write: **I listen to the needs of my body, big or small.**
