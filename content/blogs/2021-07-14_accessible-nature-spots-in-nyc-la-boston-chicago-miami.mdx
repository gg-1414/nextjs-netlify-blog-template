    One of the biggest shifts this past year is how many of us have been able to
    reconnect with nature. We've needed to take a break from our screens, get
    some fresh air, and nourish our nervous systems. Hopefully this renewed love
    for the outdoors, be it a beautiful 8 mile hike or the park around the
    corner, will be something we all hold onto. Having a relationship with
    nature doesn't mean we have to drive hours on end, we can be in tune with
    our environments just be finding spots in our own city that give us a
    moments peace. Here are our favorite accessible nature spots across the
    country!
