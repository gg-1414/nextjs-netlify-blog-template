    **essay:**


    Ethel's Club began as a figment of my solitary and wanting imagination. A seed of an idea rooted in seeking something bigger than myself, designed around people who are changing the world — artists, healers, makers, designers and writers. People who breathe life, soul and energy into the rest of us. People who make us feel joy. They are people who make us feel seen and celebrated.


    And then that seed bloomed into a physical space. My imagination became a reality I could touch and feel. I was no longer on my own, but building alongside a team of artists, healers, and designers - the very people who inspired my vision. It was magic.


    Our local Brooklyn brand took the world by storm and upon opening doors, the clubhouse grew into something much bigger and more meaningful — a digital space making it easier for people all over the world to feel better, lighter and more connected. Our team was small, but we made it happen — we were helping people change their lives. And now, we're excited to continue this work into our next chapter.


    As a group of people with varied lived experiences and identities, it was important we build a digital product that **really** spoke to who we are and who we are becoming. We were eager to build something that felt both fresh and vital to the world we live in today.


    The last few months of creation have been a commitment to accessibility, affordability, support and collective dreaming — how can we build pathways designed for the most people to feel better? What if alongside community centered experiences there were personalized journeys made for those looking to go deeper? Could there be a way for Ethel's Club to digitally meet you exactly where you are, in this moment?


    And so, in a winding sort of way, we have just arrived. Back to the beginning - back to a question that lingers: How do we feel better, together, all of the time?


    Welcome to our first chapter: ARRIVAL


    We're excited to be starting here (again) with you and we hope you love it.


    Designed by us, for you — like always.
