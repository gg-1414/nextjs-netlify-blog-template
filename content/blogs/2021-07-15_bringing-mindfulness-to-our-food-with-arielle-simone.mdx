    #### Tell me a little bit about yourself and what brought you to the work
    you do and what motivates you.


    My name is Arielle Simone and I'm a holistic nutrionist. I teach people how to eat for energy and transform their relationship with food and understand who we are as emotional eaters. We eat when we're sad, when we don't like our job, we eat through and with our feelings. So it's important for us to feed our feelings in multiple holistic ways. We should eat for nourishment and joy! For joy!


    #### What brought you to this work?


    I used to be a model, and it was so hard and I really lost myself and was very sick. It took me getting sick in Paris and realizing I had to move my body intentionally. I was working out 5-6 days a week, was so disconnected from my body and my diet. I was doing everything I shouldn't be doing. I needed to relook at my lifestyle and that brought me to health and wellness, I studied to be personal trainer, did group fitness and then realized you could go to the gym everyday but your diet is so important which brought me to nutrition.


    I then learned about the psychology behind eating, and when I get certified with holistic nutrition. I was like 'We are helping people eat to live'


    #### How do you begin your work with individuals who want to have a healthier relationship with food?


    So we start off with a health assessment form and learn more about how someone is taking care of their life on a holistic level, mind, body soul. I believe life is in your habits so we start with looking at daily habits and centering how someone wants to feel versus how they've been feeling. A lot of people don't have a morning routine, getting good sleep, don't have a creative hobby, don't enjoy their jobs and we need to have intention around how we feed our lives.


    #### What advice to give to people while they're going through these big life changes and upheavel?


    It can feel like a lot, you're telling me to drink more water move my body, eat more veggies, and be creative and love my job? That's a lot! I tell people always to just start with the morning and be willing to adjust everyday. If everyday doesn't go according to the big goals, then just adjust day to day. I like to call it "Finding your 50" so if 100 is you're hitting all your goals you're feeling great everyday, cooking all your meals - then how do find your balance at 50? I didn't meal prep and I'm going to order out, but how can I make that a healthier decision? Giving yourself more compassion and flexibility. I didn't exercise 3-4 times a week, but can I stretch? What does my body need right now? We sometimes spiral or get upset when we can't hit this perfect goal, but then we can remember everything we're doing is a part of wellness we can have more flexibility around what wellness looks like in our days.


    #### What does holistic nourishment look like in your life?


    I'm finding a lot of joy in movement, I'm realizing that's my body's love language. But I really need creativity right now in my life, I love trying new vegetables and new dishes. I just tried rutabaga, its between a potato and onion, like a purple turnip! That's another fun thing too, just pick up something new that you've never tried before and learn how to cook with it.


    #### How do we incorporate more mindfulness into our eating?


    I tell everyone, try and have one meal a day where it's just you and your meal and it's real intimate. We're on a little date, I love you and you're going to love on me. We need to put our phones away, stop talking and getting distracted and really take our time to see if we even like certain foods. Do I even like broccoli? Do I like spicy food? We can start seeing more clearly without all the other distractions.


    Also creating an inventory on how foods make you feel. You can do that physically by having like a physical food journal, or you could just even have a notes app. So I would say like take time out to like five to 10 minutes before you eat. Just think about how you feel. Are you irritated? Are you aggravated? Are you hungry? Bored? Being honest with that and that five to 10 minutes of being intentional helps us to just be more mindful to the decision that we're about to make what our food. So let's say we get the full feeling while eating, within 30 minutes afterwards, you want to kind of just see how you feel. Are you tired? Are you, or did it give you energy? We don't even realize like a lot of our food makes us tired. It drains our energy and that's quite the opposite of what food is supposed to do.


    #### Are there any fun projects you're working on?


    I am working on an intentional planner and that is a project that I'm super amped about. It's pretty a planner with like 12 different months where we focus on different wellness intentions. So one month is strictly focused on cooking more. Another month is moving more, another month to sleeping, drinking, water, checking your financial wellness etc.


    #### What is a book that has transformed the way you see the world or that you just really enjoy?


    Two cookbooks that I love are [Eat Like You Give a Fork](https://mareyaibrahim.com/book/) and [Afro Vegan](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/225436/afro-vegan-by-bryant-terry/), I love that cookbook because it's just like the recipes my mom makes bit a little healthier.


    #### Where are you finding joy or hope?


    I'm finding joy in moving my body, journaling, and I'm so excited to pick up some creative hobbies.


    #### If you could be any plant what plant would you be?


    I would be a bird of paradise, they are tropical and beautiful and radiant.
