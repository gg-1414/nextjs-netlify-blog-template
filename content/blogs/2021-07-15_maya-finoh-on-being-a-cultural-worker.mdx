    #### **Hello maya! I'm so eager to hold digital space with you, tell me a
    little bit about yourself and what brought you to the work you do.**


    My name is maya finoh, I use they/dem pronouns. I was born and raised in Durham, North Carolina (occupied Eno/Occaneechi land). My parents immigrated here from Sierra Leone. I am Black, queer, fat, non-binary, a cultural worker, a model, and a critical thinker outside of academia. I am a prison/police abolitionist, fat liberationist, and Black feminist. I am rooted in the [Black Radical Imagination](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AdbuhNaBcbc) and a believer in the liberation of all living things.


    #### **What does it mean to be a cultural worker?**


    I've come to terms with this identity recently. Before the start of the pandemic, I would have only said I’m an organizer but within this time of slowing down and having a lot more space to reflect I’ve realized that going out into the streets—which is absolutely needed for change—is not necessarily where I can spend the majority of my energy or how I see myself primarily engaging in struggle at this moment. As someone interested in revolution, interested in liberation, I'm still trying to figure out what my movement tools are: writing, advocacy, political education, modeling as a person who doesn’t fit into western beauty standards… all of these facets feel important and are a part of my work.


    There’s [this article](https://medium.com/@DevynSpringer/cultural-worker-not-a-creative-4695ae8bfd2d) by an artist, writer, and educator named Devyn Springer, it’s called “Cultural Worker Not A ‘Creative’”. The article pushes back on the capitalist idea of saying “oh, I'm a content creator, I'm a creative, I'm an influencer, etc” and instead calls on us to take on the duty of creating art and culture that speaks truth to power and is in service of something bigger than our individual wants. For me, this means creating art and culture in service of the liberation of all people, particularly Black people, trans people, fat people, and disabled people. I would really like to emphasize that being a cultural worker means you have to have a clear idea of what you’re up against and some idea of what you’re building towards. You can’t do this alone either: you have to be principled and in coalition with people who are also invested in what you’re fighting against/fighting for. That’s my personal definition of what it means to be a culture worker. I hope that explains it!


    #### **What motivates you and your work?**


    My lived experience. Just living within the structural realities of being a Black queer non-binary fat person, growing up poor, growing up in the South, and being the child of immigrants. My entire life I’ve seen a direct attack on the communities I am a part of that’s tied to the structures of capitalism, ableism, patriarchy, and anti-Blackness. What motivates me is the desire to get free, not only for myself, but also for my loved ones and other marginalized peoples.


    #### **What does wellness or ‘being well’ mean to you? Do you have any critiques of current wellness culture or what is missing?**


    My biggest critique is how alienating popular wellness culture can be and how intertwined it is with capitalism. There are always products that are being pushed on us to buy, and expensive classes taught by white people who often appropriate BIPOC forms of healing. Also, wellness culture often pushes individualized solutions for pain/harm caused by systematic oppression. Popular wellness culture is also extremely fatphobic, and the whole idea of a 'healthy and good body' was created by western european colonizers in opposition to Blackness. I don't even know if our society as it's currently configured can give me wellness if that makes sense.


    I think that I will be well when the revolution comes, when I no longer have to constantly fight against all the -isms. Since we’re not there yet, the little ways I embody wellness are by being in deep community with people embodying liberation. For example, knowing that I have people who are going to look out for me and encourage me to take up space when I go out in public as a fat Black queer person in New York City is significant. Also, saying no and having boundaries: boundaries that celebrate my autonomy and self-determination. Honoring the things that bring me desire and pleasure is another way I work towards wellness.


    #### **Where do you find joy and play?**


    Through reading, singing loudly to myself around my apartment, watching films directed by Black women visionaries, eating delicious food, wearing beautiful outfits, and curating playlists (I have about 150 playlists on Spotify). Also, meeting up with and laughing with my friends!


    #### **What are you reading right now or what is a book that has transformed the way you see yourself or the world?**


    I’m reading the Salt Eaters by Toni Cade Bambara right now. Assata Shakur’s autobiography is brilliant and completely changed me. We say her words and invoke her so often in movement spaces. I think that that's really powerful.


    #### **If you could be any plant what plant would you be?**


    I would be a bird of paradise. They are gorgeous tropical plants indigenous to the African continent and they need to soak up the sun in order to grow—I’m a Leo Sun, Leo Mercury, and Leo Venus so I relate to this need very much. Also when the flowers bloom?! Bird of paradise flowers are truly the perfect palette: orange, lavender, fuchsia, red, and green are my favorite colors to wear.
