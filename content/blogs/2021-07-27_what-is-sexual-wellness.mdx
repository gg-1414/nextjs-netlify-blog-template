    Sexual care is self care. It’s important to carve out time in our day to
    practice sexual wellness. While this may seem obvious, why is it so
    important to prioritize wellness? Much of what we think we know about sexual
    health comes from a patriarchal male point of view. It is only more
    recently, with a more critical understanding of sex and gender, that
    sexuality has become more inclusive and reframed from a queer and female
    standpoint.


    Sexual health wellness is an expansive concept, below are some practical tips on how to get started.

    #### Setting goals


    Different people approach sexuality differently. What works for one may not work for another. Creating a plan can help create clarity about what your individual goals are. This can include masturbating more regularly, getting in touch with your sexuality, coming out to yourself, trying out a new form of contraceptive this year or dating outside your comfort zone.

    #### Finding sensuality in everyday life


    Sensual and sexual acts aren’t just reserved for the bedroom. Sexuality extends beyond sexual acts: it can extend to clothing, food and behaviours. Wear a sexy piece of lingerie just for the fun of it; eat some fruit, let it drip down your arms, lick your fingers sensually; massage some lotion on your feet. Go at your own pace and find ways to introduce activities that feel comfortable to you.

    #### Practicing mindfulness


    Mindfulness meditation can be an integral part of sexual practices. You can mindfully watch porn, read erotica, and masturbate. You don’t necessarily need to be a monk to do any of these mindfully! Simply breathing deeply can exponentially increase your orgasm and finding a center of focus can alleviate any associated anxieties. In addition to mindfulness, visualization and journaling are also key pieces of practicing sexual wellness.

    #### Find your ritual


    Incorporate little rituals in your sexual wellness plan. For example, masturbating before a shower every morning, finding time to write down affirmations about your sexual health, doing kegel exercises, stretching before and after sex, or buying from a favourite sexual wellness brand. Rituals can have variety if you don’t enjoy routines and like to spice it up everyday. Find what works for your schedule and liking!

    #### Prioritizing the important stuff


    As much as it’s important to find time to masturbate and explore your sensuality, it’s just as important to invest time and resources around your sexual health. Finding the right contraceptive method, a more sustainable form of menstrual products and going for regular health check ups/tests are essential practices to include.


    Think of sexual wellness as a map into your soul. Part of the journey is finding what works for you, where you want to go, how you want to get there, and visualizing what the final destination looks like. Remember this can always change! You may not be able to draw up this map immediately and that’s okay, what’s most important is that your sexual health roadmap is unique to you and trusting that you’ll eventually figure it out.
