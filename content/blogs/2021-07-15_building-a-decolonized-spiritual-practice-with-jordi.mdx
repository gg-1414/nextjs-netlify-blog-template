    #### **Hi Jordi! Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us. To start,
    can you tell us about yourself and the parts that are most important to
    you?**


    I have many names, Jordi, Jordianna, and Jordan are my go-tos. I am a shape-shifter, I'm a scorpio moon and a libra rising and so those two togethers aid and cater to different aspects of myself and different lives I experience even within myself. I am a many-named being! I identify as a Black person, melanated person, displaced indigenous person of the African diaspora, I'm navigating my identity outside of nationalism and the illusion of boundaries created by the state. That goes as deep as race and gender. I am a nonconforming being and I was identifying as trans up until recently and I am seeing the commodification of trans identity and resonate with agender and see myself as a genderless/genderfull being.


    #### **How do you navigate doing deep soul and healing work within the systems of capitalism?**


    I do many things and I get that from my Gemini mom. As a Black single mother I saw her hustle and flow  working so many different jobs, that was my first introduction to navigating this capitalistic world. I started working at a very young age, I started in the entertainment industry, I am an artist, a creator, and it wasn't until leaving university and being in different local organizing spaces — I was named as a healer in those spaces. I was in a collective space where people told me "Your presence is healing". My natural inclination is to ask what's wrong and offer things that could help. I saw a need for collective healing. I was healing myself while actively being in community.


    #### **What does your ancestral work look like and how does it tie into your spiritual practices?**


    I mean, I think the two are tied together and are very important. I'll start by talking about the people of the African diaspora who have lineages through chattel slavery on this land/continent. There was a specific spell that was cast like an insidious curse of intertwining the relationship with their bodies and land to be one of pain, to be one of trauma and one of bloodshed. It's necessary to acknowledge that in order to heal from this pain. I work to have a relationship with the land and to my own body.


    #### **What steps would you suggest to people who want to start building a spiritual practice or some sort of ritual?**


    There is a lot of extraction from different cultures especially due to colonial violence. There is a relationship that our bodies have to land, and starting with acknowledging that and learning more about the land we occupy. We need to understand that there are Indigenous people at war for their land and that we all have ancestral legacies we need to reckon and connect with.


    So first we need to go back to a source and I think that begins with our relationship to nature. I don't think it's a coincidence that many people who are very religious or evangelical Christian do not believe in evolution. There is a disconnection with the reality that we crawled out of the oceans that we were birthed in those waters, that and that we are animals with a relationship to nature. These are the same sources we continue to pump for money, that we continue to pollute and harm our ancient home. It's so easy to disrespect that when we sever our connection to the natural world.


    The next step people can take is to research - what are your ancestral lands? If they are not where you are living. What legacies and histories are you connected to? Go back. Research, watch a documentary, learn about what those people on that land ate etc. Then see if you can integrate like any of the physical things that they ate, what they smelled, what they used on their body. These practices will allow your body to physically return to these places, bring these elements to your body to allow your body to return home. The more that you study, the more that you call in that relationship with the land, the more that it will guide you and teach you and inform your spiritual practice.


    #### **Can you tell us more about your book?**


    Yes! It's called 'Lil Book of Potions' and it is 29 blends for potions that align with the 29 Night Moon cycle. The intention is to share knowledge of herbs, spices, foods, and flowers that have the potential to aid our healing journeys...individually and collectively. Each mixture corresponds with the New, Full, Waning, and Waxing Moon periods as well as Lunar and Solar Eclipses. I really hope that this book allows people to have a relationship with non linear lunar cycles while also deepening their daily practice to ritual and magic. You can find the book [here](https://earthtojordi.com/store/lil-book-of-potions).


    #### **If you could be any plant what plant would you be?**


    I would be mycelium.Mushrooms. They are spongy and cold and close to the earth. Abundant giving.


    #### **Where are you finding hope and joy?**


    I'm finding hope within arms reach. So many things outside of myself remind me I don't have control. There is so much violence and trauma happening even thousands of miles away from me, but then there are things within arms reach that capture my attention, I like to remember that even inside me there are cycles of change and growth as my cells die and new ones burst. So I try to tap into that to remember that these cycles of life and death are close to me and part of us. Also the people in my community near and far, celebrating with them, visiting them has also given me hope and joy.
